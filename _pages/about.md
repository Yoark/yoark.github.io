Zijiao Yang (杨子蛟 in Chinese) is a Ph.D. student at Oregon State University, advised by Prof. [Stefan Lee](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/). He earned Master's degree in computer science at University of Colorado at Boulder.

His research interest is ultimately driven by the mystery of human intelligence, and he believes achieving a "deep" level of <u>language grounding</u> is one of the key steps. He has worked on semantic role labeling during Master's. Currently, he takes vision-language navigation tasks as a platform to study groundness of natural language onto vision and actions.
